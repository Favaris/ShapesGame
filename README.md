# Shapes Game
 Simple game client where you can draw some shapes and change them in different ways. Client can save the game progress and download it from a file. In latter versions I'd like to add multiplayer (I have a raw concept of it so far) and make the interface more user friendly.

I use Swing to create the GUI. Also a class from the ICY package is used - Polygon2D, since to implement scaling and rotating I needed a Polygon with floating point coordinates and java.awt only provides a Polygon with int coords.
